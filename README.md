## About

<td>

Hi,  

My name is Ritvik and I am currently a Computer Science student. Some of my hobbies/interests include Paleontology, Cricket, Sci-Fi, Comedy, and Film.
  
if you are reading this you have likely read my resume and are interested in some of the projects I have worked on. For obvious reasons I cannot display everything I have worked on, but here are some of my passion/hobby projects I have done. Some projects may just be summaries of the work, while others may be full on code repositories. I hope you enjoy looking through these!
